- Hi, I’m @DoraNenoy 👋

- I’m on my way to becomimg a good programmer. 😄
- I’m currently learning web development technologies like: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
  This is just the beginning and so far I have a little knowledge and expierence, but I try very hard to change it all. 💪

- Of course this isn't the only interest in my life. I really love everything that is related to creativity, such as drawing. 
  Drawing helps me find inspiration and stay positive.🎨

- Also I've a husky puppy Stormy and I love her so much. 🐾🥰 

- If you have any questions or you just want a funny picture of my dog then write me an e-mail: doranenoy@gmail.com 📫
